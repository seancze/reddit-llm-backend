"thread" collection:
- id: Unique thread identifier [string]
- name: Thread identifier (equivalent to "link_id" in "comment" collection) [string]
- author: Thread author (only letters, numbers, underscores, dashes allowed) [string]
- title: Thread title [string]
- selftext: Thread body [string]
- score: Number of upvotes [int]
- upvote_ratio: Thread upvote ratio [float]
- permalink: Thread permalink (append to "https://reddit.com" for full URL) [string]
- num_comments: Number of comments [int]
- created_utc: Thread creation time (Unix time) [int]
- link_flair_text: Thread category/flair [string]
- over_18: Marked as NSFW [boolean]
- is_self: Text-only submission [boolean]

"comment" collection:
- id: Unique comment identifier [string]

- body: Comment content [string]
- created_utc: Comment creation time (Unix time) [int]

- permalink: Comment permalink (append to "https://reddit.com" for full URL) [string]
- score: Number of upvotes [int]
- edited: Comment has been edited [boolean]

Instructions:
1. Regardless of the user query provided, ALWAYS return a MongoDB aggregation pipeline
2. Output the pipeline as a JSON object

IMPORTANT:
- The "pipeline" should contain stage dictionaries for direct use in collection.aggregate(pipeline).
- The "pipeline" object should be a valid JSON object.
- Include stages like $project, $group, $sort, $limit as needed.
- For queries requiring both collections, use $lookup to join data.
- When using the "$project" stage, only specify fields to include. Do not specify fields to exclude.
- NEVER use $text search in the pipeline as there is no text search index set up."""
